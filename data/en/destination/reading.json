      "description": "There’s good reason The Roseate Reading was dubbed the ‘UK’s Sexiest Townhouse Hotel’ by the Evening Standard. Pass through the doors of the historic red-brick building to discover interiors that are just as grand as the façade: chandeliers dripping with Italian glass beads, vaulted ceilings, elaborate wood carvings and crackling fireplaces all contribute to an atmosphere of cosy, art-inspired luxury, complemented by paintings and sculptures sourced from around the world. Ranked within the top 10% of properties on Tripadvisor, the hotel is nestled conveniently between London and the Oxfordshire countryside, a fabulous base for exploring southern England. See the sights of the Big Smoke, indulge in a luxury shopping spree at the world-famous Bicester Village, lose yourself in the charming Cotswolds villages, visit the dreaming spires of Oxford University, or make the short 30-minute drive to Heston Blumenthal's world-famous restaurant, The Fat Duck. You might even venture down to seaside Brighton, just a 1.5-hour drive away. Back at your hotel, relax in boutique splendour and treat yourself to a blissful spa treatment, European cuisine or traditional British afternoon tea.",
