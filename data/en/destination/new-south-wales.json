      "description": "Set on 50 acres of native bushland and sand dunes fronting Belongil Beach, this luxurious, design-led escape lets nature set the pace and barefoot elegance reign. Just a few minutes north of Byron Bay, the resort feels a world away with private villas inspired by the surrounding ecosystems - Dunal, Rainforest, Eucalypt and Wetlands - each thoughtfully crafted with natural textures. Days unfold slowly here, with mornings spent on a daybed at the adults-only pool or floating in the vast central lagoon shaded by palms. Azure Bar and Grill serves seasonal dishes made from local ingredients, while the Botanica Beach Lounge spills out onto the sand with plush lounges and ocean views. Sink into serenity at Osprey Spa, or if you're feeling adventurous, the resort's outdoor activities range from sunrise horse rides along the beach to dips in the surf and forest walks through tea tree groves. Even getting into town is a dream, with the world's first solar-powered train accessible from the resort ready to take you gliding through the dunes to Byron’s heart.",
