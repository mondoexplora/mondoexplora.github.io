      "description": "A true paradise for wine and food lovers, Hacienda Zorita Wine Hotel & Organic Farm is a peaceful oasis set amid the gorgeous vineyards of Spain's world-famous Douro Valley, right on the banks of River Tormes. Part of the prestigious Small Luxury Hotels of the World collection, Hacienda Zorita Wine Hotel & Organic Farm is a countryside haven where rich history and modern facilities go hand in hand. When you're not enjoying a wine tasting, take the 20-minute drive to UNESCO World Heritage-listed Salamanca, a mesmerising mix of art, history and vibrant modern life. Stroll the grand square of the city, considered one of the most beautiful plazas in all of Spain, wander the halls of the oldest library in Europe and embrace the Spanish lifestyle with vino and tapas in one of the city's overflowing bars. Housed in a former Dominican monastery, dating back to the 14th century and reputedly once visited by Christopher Columbus, the hacienda boasts just 40 beautifully appointed rooms complete with original stone walls, magnificent oak beams and fine works of art. World-class service and contemporary facilities await, including an elegant wine bar, day spa specialising in wine therapy, stunning wine cellar and a glorious outdoor pool surrounded by serene grounds. The gourmet farm-to-table restaurant, Zorita's Kitchen, sources produce from the estate's 250-hectare organic farm, located just minutes from the hotel.",
