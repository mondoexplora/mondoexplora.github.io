      "description": "Tranquillity, charm and history go hand-in-hand at Aethos Corsica - a restored 17th-century palace set atop a spectacular village on the Mediterranean island of Corsica. This family-owned boutique hotel boasts arresting views across the northern bay of France's Saint-Florent and its unspoiled beaches. Aethos Corsica features just nine tastefully stylish rooms, and each one looks out across the surrounding mountains and sea. The immaculately manicured garden, dotted with olive and palm trees, surrounds the heart of the hotel - a 20-metre lap pool perfectly suited to relaxed afternoons spent on sunbeds or swimming. The astounding geographical diversity of Corsica will not be lost on you, as there are endless ways for you to explore this mountainous Mediterranean paradise. When you are ready to step away from your hilltop hideaway, ranked within the top 10% of properties on Tripadvisor, you could spend your days hiking along the nearby trails or, if water-based adventure is more to your tastes, hire a kayak, snorkelling gear or fishing equipment to see what hides below the ocean's glistening surface. Unforgettable experiences await, and a stay at the regal Aethos Corsica makes living out your Mediterranean island fantasy effortless.",
