      "description": "Fly high in one of the world’s ultimate bucket-list locations with a stay at Ariana Sustainable Luxury Lodge in Cappadocia, Turkey. Sitting pretty atop the Uchisar Valley, the luxurious lodging boasts breathtaking views of the semi-arid landscapes below, providing a front-row seat to the iconic hot air balloon show above. The hotel (a member of Small Luxury Hotels of the World and a Tripadvisor Travellers' Choice 2020 winner) prides itself on eco-conscious initiatives, including a Tesla charging point and commitment to producing 26% of its energy through solar power. History buffs will delight in its prime position, with the underground city of Kaymakli, Uchisar Citadel and Goreme Open Air Museum all just a short drive away. Each room and suite at Ariana Sustainable Luxury Lodge takes on the name of an ancient goddess - Kamrusepa is the goddess of healing, medicine and magic, while Aruru is the goddess of fertility, mountains and rulers. Decadent details make each room more than worthy of their namesake deity, with jewelled tones, natural materials and contemporary comforts sitting alongside eco-friendly features and beautifully preserved remnants of the ancient caves they are housed in. They form the perfect base for exploring what Cappadocia has to offer, best organised by the on-site concierge. From horse riding to hot air ballooning, off-road driving to a photography tour, there are plenty of ways to explore the UNESCO-listed sites just outside your front door. At the end of all your adventuring, a fine-dining feast awaits at The Plum Restaurant, where a perfectly placed sun terrace features jaw-dropping views of both the action outside and the property’s private vineyard. The ultra-seasonal Mediterranean menu celebrates farm-fresh local ingredients, giving you a taste of Turkey with every bite. **Luxury Escapes inclusions (select nights)** - Admire Cappadocia’s skyline while enjoying **daily à la carte breakfast** at The Plum Restaurant - Start your stay with a **welcome glass of champagne** - Find out why The Plum Restaurant is one of Cappadocia’s finest dining experiences with a **dinner for two** (for stays of 2+ nights) **Ishtar Suite Upgrade:** For a little extra space, treat yourself to a stay in the Ishtar Duplex Suite with Private Deck, complete with a separate living room, luxurious bathroom and private deck.",
