      "description": "Embrace peaceful luxury living at The Xcape River Kwai, a design-led boutique hotel perched on the banks of the Kwai Noi River in Thailand. Surrounded by rice paddies and sugar cane plantations, with a mountain-range backdrop, this serene sanctuary couldn’t seem further from the bustle of Bangkok - but is just a 2.5-hour drive from the capital. While you may be tempted to spend all your time in the water, there’s plenty to explore on land: the historic city of Kanchanaburi is 20 minutes away, as is the River Kwai bridge, made famous by the iconic 1950s movie The Bridge on the River Kwai. With avant-garde architecture that pays homage to the industrial history of the area, The Xcape River Kwai features just eight cabins, styled to resemble shipping containers. Contemporary comforts abound in both private and public areas, including The Bridge Bar & Bistro, where Thai and Western delights are served from sun-up to well past sundown. While each room faces the river, the best spot for water-gazing is the infinity pool, complete with comfortable sunbeds. When the time comes to explore further afield, hop on a complimentary bicycle for an afternoon well spent. Ranked among the top 1% of properties worldwide on Tripadvisor, this hotel is a tranquil Thai luxury at its finest. **Luxury Escapes inclusions:** - Start each morning with **daily breakfast** at The Bridge Bar & Bistro - Embrace that holiday feeling with a refreshing **welcome cocktail** - Head to The Bridge Bar & Bistro for one **two-course lunch or dinner** (for stays of 2+ nights) - Float into pure peacefulness with a **30-minute massage per adult** (for stays of 3+ nights) **Overwater River Upgrade:** Spend your days perched directly over the Kwai Noi River, lounging on your outdoor mesh daybed, exploring the water by kayak or taking in the view from your private rooftop when you upgrade to an XFloat Luxe Cabin. **Tripadvisor Traveller's Choice Awards 2021** Top Small Hotels - Thailand",
