    "description": "Experience a truly unique wilderness adventure at the luxurious Xigera Safari Lodge in the UNESCO World Heritage-listed Okavango Delta. Perfectly positioned amid the expansive wetlands of the Moremi Game Reserve, this remarkable property is the first purpose-built safari lodge developed by the acclaimed Red Carnation Collection.\n\nMeticulously designed and built with sustainability in mind and with a nod to Africa's heritage, art and culture, the lodge has just 12 suites set amid a canopy of indigenous trees that overlook seasonal floodplains filled with wildlife. Each spacious air-conditioned lodging features bespoke art, indoor and outdoor dining areas, and full room service. But the pièce de résistance is most certainly the breathtaking front-row seat to the African bush theatre each lodge affords - from the freestanding baths overlooking the Okavango wilderness to the secluded private outdoor decks.",
