Commanding an enviable city-centre position, a stone’s throw from lively Cuba Street, this four-story, heritage-listed building is the place to be and be seen following a three-year, multimillion-dollar refurbishment. Formerly a Cadbury chocolate factory, this boutique complex now offers 18 luxurious, industrial-chic rooms - each stripped back to their raw brick beauty. From the visually aesthetic lobby, adorned with locally inspired artwork, old-world charm and moody, deep colours (with zero replicas or hotel art clichés in sight), to the historic interior touches, this urban sanctuary is a contemporary hideaway and perfect nod to Wellington's alternative side.\n\nStanding proud in the heart of the Te Aro neighbourhood, on vibrant Ghuznee Street, the hotel is ideally located in the thick of the action. Chic cafés, stately-but-far-from-stuffy fine dining restaurants and independent boutiques rub shoulders with the city’s must-see attractions - Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, Wellington Cable Car and Wellington Botanic Garden are a short drive away. Back at the hotel, head down to Puffin - complete with plush velvet booths and taxidermied birds - to sate your thirst with a variety of natural and organic wines, classic cocktails and craft beers, accompanied by delicious nibbles.",
