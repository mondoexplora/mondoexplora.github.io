    "description": "There are stays that just seem to tick all of the boxes, and the newly renovated Mantra Epping on Melbourne's outskirts does just that; try a negroni at the onsite Twist Distilling within Republic Tavern Brewpub; savour generous American grill pub meals at the thriving Beer Republic Brewery; and be wined and dined in high style at your new gin lover's retreat. Hop from one to another in slow succession (each is to be thoroughly enjoyed) and barely spare what lies beyond your hotel a thought. Though, if you're tempted, you're close to an abundance of family-friendly playgrounds and walking distance to Pacific Epping plaza.",
