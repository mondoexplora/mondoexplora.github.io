    "description": "It would be remiss to label Bullo River Station as simply an accommodation option in the Kimberley - it’s a one-of-a-kind experience that will stay with you long after you’ve left its remote location. On the edge of the East Kimberley region in Australia’s Northern Territory, the luxury working cattle station and homestead sits on half a million acres of pristine outback, encompassing gorges, waterfalls and the Victoria and Bullo rivers. The front gate is 50km from the homestead and the closest neighbours are three hours away - this is the true Australian outback.\n\nSpend your days riding horses through gorges, cruising the Bullo river, looking out for wildlife and admiring the station from above with a helicopter ride. Swim in billabongs, picnic by waterfalls and learn more about the ancient Miriuwung-Gajerrong culture by exploring traditional rock art sites. Don't miss the exclusive helicopter touring experience to Victoria River Lookout. Perched high on a rocky outcrop, overlooking Victoria River, awe-inspiring doesn’t do this location justice. Wake early and experience it at sunrise or spend a romantic evening admiring the view at sunset with a platter and drinks.\n\nAfter adventurous days, retire to your purpose-built, air-conditioned ensuite room, laze by the homestead pool, or take your pick of hammocks among the palm trees. Meals are a communal affair - breakfast is served on the veranda and dinners celebrate the bevvy of beautiful ingredients found on the station, including organic prime beef and barramundi (that you may have even caught yourself!). Lunch is incorporated into your daily activity, with fresh treats packed by the team.",
