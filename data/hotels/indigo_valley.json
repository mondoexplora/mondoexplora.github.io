    "description": "Escape to rural Victoria with a stay at Koendidda Country House, a luxuriously charming country hideaway. Built during the gold rush era in the 1850s, this is a slice of old-world serenity, with warm open fireplaces to cosy up in front of with a glass of red, and a gorgeous formal dining room.\n\nLeave the hustle and bustle of the city behind in the quaint town of Barnawartha, a three-hour drive from Melbourne. Koendidda Country House is a place to savour at leisure, strolling the immaculate gardens, listening to the chorus of birds first thing in the morning, and revelling in the quiet ambience of rural Victoria. Drive around 25 minutes from the estate to Rutherglen’s wine region, home to more than 20 vineyards with outstanding restaurants and cafés. Discover the delicious aged muscat at the vine-covered All Saints Estate, linger for a bite at De Bortoli and hire a vintage bike at St Leonards Vineyard to explore Rutherglen at your own pace.",
