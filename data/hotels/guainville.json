    "title": "French Countryside Mansion Estate One Hour from Paris with Breathtaking Gardens & Spa",
    "description": "Surrounded by rambling provincial hills, hundred-year woodlands and rose-filled gardens, Domaine de Primard offers a unique countryside escape for those craving old-world French hospitality. Only an hour’s drive west of Paris, the estate is elevated by modern luxury and exalted by an extraordinary surrounding 99-acre garden seemingly plucked from a fairytale. Gourmands will savour the tremendous culinary options available, led by Chef Romain Meder - dine amongst the apple orchards at Octave, offering rustic, seasonal and deeply authentic French fare; savour every dazzling sip of champagne at the riverside Veuve Cliquot Bar or enjoy every intimate bite by the blazing fireplace at the timeless La Table d'Hôtes.\n\nEach day is yours to enjoy however you please - indulge in the transformative treatments offered at Susanne Kaufmann Spa (the first of its kind in France), enjoy a cocktail by the pool or simply lose yourself amongst the park’s abundance of natural wonders, each an Impressionistic painting wrought vividly to life.",
