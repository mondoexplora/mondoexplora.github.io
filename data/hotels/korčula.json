    "description": "Tick off a bucket-list escape with a stay at Korčula's Aminess Liburna Hotel. This modern hotel sits on a picture-perfect patch of Croatia's coastline with panoramic views of Korčula's fortified Old Town (just a 10-minute walk away) and the slopes of Pelješac across the water. \n\nA pebble-and-rock beach and circular outdoor saltwater pool form the perfect backdrop to a stay at Aminess Liburna Hotel, with plenty of space for sun-worshipping under tamarisk trees or on parasol-covered sunbeds. Hire bikes to explore the nearby promenade, villages, or beaches of Lumbarda, or hire sailing boats, stand-up paddleboards and kayaks from the watersports centre. Return for a massage at the beauty centre or find your spot on the hotel restaurant’s terrace to watch the sunset with a cocktail in hand.",
