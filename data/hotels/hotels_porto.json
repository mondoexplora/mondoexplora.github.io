    "title": "Top-Rated Porto Heritage Palace Escape",
    "description": "Experience the grandeur of Portuguese royalty with a stay at Torel 1884 Suites & Apartments, consistently ranked among the top hotels in Porto on Tripadvisor. Housed in a former palace dating back to 1884, this historic hotel is now a slice of sophisticated extravagance in the heart of the city, sitting just metres from some of Porto’s best sites, including the iconic Rua das Flores. If you fancy venturing a little further afield, São Bento train and metro station is a three-minute walk away.\n\nEach room in this palatial building combines original features with styling inspired by the discoveries of Portuguese explorers as they travelled across Africa, America and Asia - think coffee, porcelain, cardamom and silk. Retreat to the top-floor library and lounge to escape reality with a good book (with tomes available in English, French, German, Portuguese and Japanese), or join the locals at Bartolomeu, the ground-floor bistro and wine bar, dishing up Portuguese flavours with a French twist. Make your way through the primarily Portuguese wine list or book in for a private tasting in the former bank safes, now storing liquid currency.",
