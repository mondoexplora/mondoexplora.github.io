    "description": "Gracefully poised on 6,000 acres above the untouched coastline in the Bay of Islands, this collection of boutique suites and villas is made for moments of quiet luxury. A world-class golf course curves through rolling hills, while three private beaches invite relaxed days by the water.\n\nDining is tide-to-table, celebrating seasonal produce from local growers and the resort’s own farmland, served in colonial-inspired The Dining Room. Unwind in the sauna, soak in the Jacuzzi, swim laps in the heated pool or float in the infinity pool, then sink deeper into serenity with a personalised spa treatment.\n\nBeyond the resort, a world of natural beauty awaits. Traverse pine forests and farmland, explore native bushland on horseback, or enjoy a private BBQ on a secluded beach. For a deeper connection, join a guided tour of the property’s indigenous Māori heritage. Whether for a romantic escape or a group retreat, this luxury resort is your refuge for rest and renewal.",
