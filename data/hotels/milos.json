    "description": "On a cliffside overlooking the Aegean Sea, the five-star Milos Cove is an architectural marvel on one of Greece's most unsung islands. Welcoming guests aged 13+, this sleek, stylish resort wows with suites and villas with private pools, a spellbinding cliffside infinity pool, the authentic Pathos Restaurant offering Mediterranean and Greek flavours, and the Obsidian wellness spa with its holistic alternative therapies.\n\nIt's not hard to see why the lesser-frequented island of Milos is a favourite of the locals. Start with the Papafragas Caves, where crystal-clear waters meet towering cliffs. Wander through the lunar-like landscapes of Sarakiniko Beach, explore sea caves and enjoy snorkelling at Kleftiko on a guided boat trip, or wrap up your days amid the authentic charm of Plaka, the island's hilltop village with its whitewashed buildings and tavernas.",
