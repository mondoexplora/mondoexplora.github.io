    "description": "Embrace the tropical vibes of the South Pacific at Coconuts Beach Club Resort and Spa Samoa, home to the only overwater bungalows in the country. This authentic beachfront resort encourages guests to relax into island life and embrace an escape with no phones, TVs or high rises in sight.\n\nThis unique Samoan oasis offers the facilities of a much larger resort, with an intimate, village-style vibe. Try delicious local cuisine at the restaurant and bar, be pampered at Coco Spa and take a refreshing dip in the gecko-shaped swimming pool (stopping for a drink at the swim-up bar, of course). As you take in the spectacular sunrises and sunsets at this magical resort, you’ll have no trouble understanding why it’s been stamped with a Tripadvisor Travellers’ Choice 2020 award.",
