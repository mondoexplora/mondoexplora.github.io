    "description": "Book yourself an invite to the hottest party in town with a stay at Ocean Drive Ibiza, an Ibiza icon that boasts beautiful views of the Old Town and Mediterranean. Sitting across from Marina Botafoch, this stylish Art Deco hotel puts the best of the Balearics at your fingertips: a 10-minute walk one way and you’re on the sands of tranquil Talamanca Bay, while 10 minutes in the other direction gets you to the front door of mega-club Pacha.\n\nOcean Drive Ibiza's classic Art Deco aesthetic takes inspiration from 1920s Miami. Each room and suite is outfitted with tones of lavender and chocolate and views of the Mediterranean or the island’s rugged mountain interior. The best seat in the house is at the rooftop lounge Sky Bar - venture to the hotel’s top level to sip on cocktails and look out to Dalt Vila (Ibiza’s Old Town) and the island of Formentera. Summer sees the bar heaving with partygoers, dancing away to tunes spun by high-profile DJs, while healthy dishes with Latin American and European influences are served in the seasonal restaurant. Come November to April, a calmer crowd calls Ocean Drive Ibiza home, opting for a relaxing and rejuvenating break in the winter sun.",

When hunger strikes, turn to the light-filled Restaurant, where Asian and Mediterranean flavours fuse for healthy dishes. Over the summer, venture to the Sky Bar, where stunning 360° views of the surrounding landscapes come standard. If you prefer dumbbells over dancing, pop into the fitness centre to work up a sweat, before finding a spot in the airy Lobby Bar for a refreshing cocktail and bite to eat.",
