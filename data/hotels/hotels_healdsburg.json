    "title": "Refined Sonoma Valley Wine Retreat with 1,000sqm Wellness Centre & Adults-Only Infinity Pool",
    "description": "In the heart of California's sun-kissed Sonoma wine country is a vineyard retreat that epitomises refined elegance: Montage Healdsburg. This top-rated, world-class Californian resort is enveloped in 258 acres of vineyards and heritage oak forests, with the Mayacamas Mountains as a breathtaking backdrop. The incredible natural setting is at the forefront in the property's design, with each of the tranquil earth-toned rooms featuring a spacious balcony with awe-inspiring vistas. Quiet moments under the California sun are best spent floating in the resort's pools - a family pool and a zero-edge adults-only pool overlooking the vineyard. Culinary flair and local ingredients are celebrated at the three dining venues, while a trip to the 1,000-square-metre spa is a journey into wellness with treatments inspired by the land.",
