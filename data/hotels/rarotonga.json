Rarotonga is an oasis where sandy white beaches, lush rainforest, coastal lagoons and scenic reefs are all just waiting to be discovered, and getting around the island is as easy as travelling clockwise, or anti-clockwise, in a rental car or scooter and traversing the whole island in as little as 45 minutes. Choose to trek along the verdant trails that zig-zag across the island, hail the hop-on, hop-off bus that travels around the island, take a day trip to Aitutaki or visit the famous Muri Night Markets. When you're ready to put your feet up for the day, stroll on over to Sandals Restaurant for dishes inspired by the Pacific Rim, or Barefoot Bar for refreshing cocktails and a selection of local and international drinks.",
