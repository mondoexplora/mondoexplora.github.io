    "description": "Pause, decompress and reconnect away from the noise at Blackbird Byron. A boutique, adults-only retreat hidden on a private road in the hills of Nightcap National Park with just a few luxurious pavilions, Blackbird Byron allows you to fully relax and recharge in romantic seclusion above Byron's lush hinterland. Let serenity embrace you as you balance your time between dips in the magnesium mineral swimming pool, framed by acres of rainforest, and sessions in the infra-red sauna. Of course, there’s also buzzing Byron Bay, just a 35-minute drive away... \n\nWhen you’re not taking in the views of the stunning hinterland, explore all that Byron Bay has to offer. You’re within easy reach of a number of cool boutiques, hip restaurants and stylish bars, as well as charming local markets, national parklands and a stunning beachfront. If you’d rather take full advantage of this romantic haven, relax in your detached pavilion and take in striking views towards Cape Byron and the Pacific Ocean or organise an in-room massage for an extra dose of relaxation (additional charges apply).",
