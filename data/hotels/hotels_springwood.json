    "description": "For that special anniversary or celebration, score brownie points with your loved one when you reserve a table at the recently opened Arrana for a memorable degustation lunch or dinner. Awarded two Chef Hats by the Australian Good Food Guide 2022 only 14 months after opening, you can rest assured that your experience goes beyond simply a great meal and becomes a talking point for years to come. Two degustation menus are on offer - a four-course or a seven-course meal - both successfully marrying native ingredients with innovative gastronomy. The menus are constantly evolving, but some highlights may include delicious mushroom with Jerusalem artichoke and black garlic, lamb backstrap served alongside pumpkin and cinnamon myrtle, and wattle seed babka with red bean (for something sweet).",
