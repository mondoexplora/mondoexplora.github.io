    "description": "Brand-new and utterly boutique, Osborn House is a five-star Southern Highlands escape surrounded by century-old pines, rambling bushland and the gentle sighing of the Australian breeze. Lovingly restored from the 19th-century heritage-listed original and elevated by award-winning interior design and walls filled with local art, each of the property’s 22 rooms is brimming with country charm and quirky style. The facilities are top-notch, with a dazzling lap pool, a tennis court, sauna, gym, and the Osborn House Spa, one of the first spas in Australia to offer innovative Akwaterra treatments. Two exceptional onsite restaurants are guaranteed to tantalise - feast upon rustic, locally sourced favourites and cocktails at George’s or savour garden-to-plate haute cuisine at Dinah’s.\n\nNestled in the heart of the Southern Highlands, only two hours from Sydney, Osborn House offers access to the region's wealth of experiences. Stand among the spectacular red-rock cascades and lush wilderness of neighbouring Morton National Park, sip your way through a host of exceptional vineyards and distilleries, or hunt for antiques in the region’s many historic towns. If you’d rather savour the serenity closer to home, Osborn House hosts traditional, Argentinian-style open-fire feasts every Sunday - a family-style asado journey that should not be missed.",
