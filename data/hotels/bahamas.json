    "description": "Kick back and relax among the Bahamas' white sandy beaches, swaying palm trees and sparkling ocean views when you switch to island time on a laidback tropical escape to Margaritaville Beach Resort. This sprawling resort covers everything you need for the perfect island escape: a private beach, reefs, 12 restaurants and bars, live music venues, a Kids’ Club, poolside bars and even an onsite waterpark.\n\nIf you can tear yourself away from the resort’s endless activities and restaurants, explore Nassau’s tempting sights. Spend the day with the flamingos at Ardastra Gardens & Wildlife Conservation Centre, visit the Queen’s Staircase and learn about the city’s history, or laze on famous Cable Beach and work on your tan. When you’re ready to return to your resort, why not head straight to the pool bar and order a cocktail? We’ll make ours a margarita, of course.",
