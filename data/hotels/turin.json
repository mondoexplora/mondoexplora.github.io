A former residence of the Italian royal family, the restored hotel remains one of the city’s architectural gems, combining contemporary comforts within a 1930s rationalist-style building.\n\nJust steps from the iconic boutiques of Via Roma and a five-minute walk from Porta Nuova train station, it couldn’t be better placed for exploring Turin on foot. Although, there’s plenty to delight before hitting the city’s cobblestone laneways - start in the basement of the hotel where you'll find one of the city’s finest wellness centres, with a spacious steam room, sauna, and whirlpool tub. Dine on fine Italian cuisine in the intimate onsite Casa Savoia restaurant, or sip on a fine wine on the panoramic terrace, complete with views over the city centre.",
