    "description": "Nothing says royalty more than the magnificent state of Rajasthan. With numerous medieval forts, palaces and the most colourful bazaars, it’s almost like traveling back to the age of the Maharajas. Rajasthan has several attractions but there are a few unexplored towns with rich histories of their own. About 140 km from Udaipur is the beautiful town of Deogarh. This charming destination is set amongst lakes and hills and is littered with pieces of history. With an endeavour to share this beauty with the world, the Deogarh family rebuilt a heritage palace, the Dev Shree to welcome travellers from all over the world. Reserve a two or three-night royal getaway and enjoy complimentary breakfast, one three-course dinner for up to two people, a visit to the local cave temple and more.",
