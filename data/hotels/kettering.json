    "description": "Leave the city behind for sleepy fishing town life with a dash of luxury when you stay at The Cove Kettering - a collection of self-contained suites along Tasmania’s southeast coast, at the gateway to Bruny Island. Discover your home away from home with private, marina-facing balconies, underfloor heating, and a spa-like ensuite with a walk-in shower. At mealtimes, head to the large, lounge dining room area which overlooks the D’Entrecasteaux Channel and Bruny Island and features an expansive terrace, perfect for a BBQ feast or glass of Tasmanian wine.\n\nEach suite offers superb views of the sailboat-studded harbour, with Bruny Island’s magnificent silhouette in the background beckoning visitors to board a ferry to explore. The ferry terminal is an easy two-minute drive or a 15-minute walk from the hotel. Once there, follow the many coastal or bushwalking tracks or visit the local farm gates or cellar doors for tastings of artisan cheese, oysters, seafood, berries, fudge, wine, whisky, gin and beer.",
