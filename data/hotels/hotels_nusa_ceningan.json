Choose a two-bedroom package for up to four, a three-bedroom package for up to six or a four-bedroom package for up to eight guests - this is the ideal family or group escape.\n\nWith the option to take advantage of two, three or all four bedrooms of the palatial villa, you can tailor your dream escape exactly to your needs. Whatever you choose, spend your mornings by the outdoor infinity pool or wander down to the sand to enjoy the privacy of your own slice of beachfront. Soak up iconic Indonesian sunsets with a cocktail in hand or cook up a feast in the open kitchen. Keen surfers will find their own version of paradise, with easy access to beautiful breaks around the island.",
