Introduce yourself to Perth’s fine dining scene as nouvelle cuisine is delivered with the care, warmth and attention to detail only a family-owned restaurant can provide. Bask in 180-degree views of the Swan River and Kings Park before being guided through a dazzling, five-course tour de force showcasing the finest fresh seafood. And you won't go thirsty - the experience is paired with four incredible wines from the internationally acclaimed Margaret River region.\n\nTo start, you will be presented with an hors d'oeuvre of black truffle butter and baguette. The first course will follow, with Tasmanian ocean trout tartare served with caviar and Australian finger lime paired with a strawberry-touched Skuttlebut rosé. Shark Bay scallops and Catalan chorizo meet wonderfully in the second course, paired with a refreshing Stella Bella Semillon Sauvignon Blanc. The third course presents an impossible choice: either grilled barramundi, Sicilian caponata, romanesco, purple potato or slow-cooked lamb shank with polenta, nduja croquette and broccolini. This is paired with a glass of either the sublime Stella Bella Chardonnay or the bright, charming Stella Bella Cabernet Merlot. Finally, finish with an elderflower crème brulée with mixed berry compote paired with the Stella Bella Pink Moscato, lovingly crafted from the finest Muscat Rose à Petits Grains in the heart of the Margaret River region.",
