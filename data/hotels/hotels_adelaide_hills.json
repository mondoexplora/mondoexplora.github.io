Be enveloped by a world of sophistication and impeccable service during this truly unique escape, which offers beautifully appointed accommodations, breathtaking views of Mount Lofty and Piccadilly Valley and over 170 years of history.  Heritage meets grandeur at this awe-inspiring 19th-century estate, reminiscent of a stately English country manor, with 30 acres of sprawling vines and manicured gardens. The cherry on top?

Days can be spent exploring over 200 vineyards and cellar doors in the Adelaide Hills, Barossa Valley and McLaren Vale, where some of the best drops in the world are waiting to be tasted. After a day of vineyard hopping, retreat to Mount Lofty Estate to treat yourself to a smoke-infused tipple at AWL, soak up the views at the Terrace Garden Bar, lavish in the attention of an expert spa therapist at Gatekeeper's Day Spa or wander through the grounds as if they were your own.",
