    "title": "Zimbabwe All-Inclusive Safari Lodge with Victoria Falls Town Tour, Daily Wildlife Activities & Roundtrip Transfers",
    "description": "Experience a truly unique wilderness adventure at the authentic Masuwe Lodge, located just minutes from the majestic Victoria Falls, listed as one of the seven natural wonders of the world. Perfectly positioned amid the expansive game lands of Chamabonda National Park and Masuwe Reserve, this remarkable property was meticulously designed and re-built with sustainability in mind in 2017, making it one of the newest safari lodges in the region. The pièce de résistance is most certainly the front-row seat to the African bush theatre each lodge affords from its furnished deck overlooking the wilderness.\n\nKnown for its dramatic landscapes and spectacular wildlife, Zimbabwe offers a journey through diverse landscapes, with the chance to spot the Big Five, then stand in awe in front of one of Earth’s greatest spectacles: Victoria Falls. Each morning wake to the sound of a crested francolin, perhaps spy a shy steenbok foraging beneath your deck as you enjoy a morning coffee delivered to your tent … and an hour later you can be riding the rapids beneath Victoria Falls, browsing the markets at Elephant Walk or bravely swinging over the Zambezi River on the exhilarating Gorge Swing!",
