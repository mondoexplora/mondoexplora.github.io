    "title": "Elegant Philippines Island Coastal Retreat with Private Beach Access, Chocolate Hour & Onsite Spa",
    "description": "Perched on Mactan Island's sunny shores, this beachfront escape is the ideal tropical getaway. You're steps away from snorkelling at Mactan Marine Sanctuary, island-hopping to Olango Bird Sanctuary, or diving with sea turtles at Nalusan Island. After a day of adventure, lounge around the outdoor pool overlooking the Hilutangan Channel, or treat yourself to a sweet treat during daily chocolate hour.\n\nThe design throughout combines Swiss attention-to-detail with Filipino warmth. Work up a sweat in the 24/7 fitness centre, indulge in a traditional hilot massage at Spa del Mar, or savour world cuisine at The Sails restaurant. Families will also love the Little Birds kids' club and private access to a white sand beach.",
