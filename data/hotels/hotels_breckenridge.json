    "description": "Mountain magic unfolds the moment you enter this opulent Breckenridge retreat - the first upscale hotel in the region - where high-altitude trails, powder-white slopes and sunrise views call you back each day. Set in an historic Colorado mining town, this is your gateway to the Rockies - just steps from the Peak 9 chairlift, ready to whisk you up the mountain.\n\nWake to sweeping alpine views from your private room or suite, then fuel up with a hearty breakfast at Edwin. Return later for wood-fired pizzas fresh from the oven, unwind with a glass of wine by the fire at The Carter - complete with live music on select nights - or soak under the stars in an outdoor hot tub as the crisp mountain sky lights up above.",
