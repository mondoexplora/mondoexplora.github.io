    "description": "Eighteenth-century country charm meets contemporary elegance at historic boutique guesthouse The Whitlock, surrounded by the boundless beauty of The Berkshires. This 1700s estate has been restored to its former glory, with each handcrafted room a celebration of the life and times of John Whitlock - the farmer and operator of the stagecoach inn that originally inhabited the building.\n\nLocated in central Lenox, you’ll be well-placed to explore the region’s abundance of natural beauty, historical significance, rich art scene and mouthwatering farm-to-table cuisine. Take in a performance at Tanglewood, summer home of Boston Symphony Orchestra, or take a joyous walk through the woods at Pleasant Valley Wildlife Sanctuary. If you’d rather stay in, The Whitlock is home to Ophelia’s Bar & Restaurant, serving dishes accentuated with the herbs and garnishes of local producers and cocktails that are comfort in a glass.",
