    "description": "Tranquility, rest and relaxation go hand in hand at Azerai Ke Ga Bay - a breathtaking resort set on the beachfront in Vietnam’s Bình Thuận province. Framed by soaring sand dunes to the west and a rocky headland and islet to the east, with perfectly manicured gardens, the idyllic resort is the definition of understated luxury. When you are ready to step away from your hidden oasis, spend your time gazing at the colourful boats in the harbour of Phan Thiết, travel further to the fishing village of Mũi Né, or roam the surrounding sand dunes.\n\nThere are plenty of ways to while away the day within the resort's grounds: laze on a sunbed by one of the four outdoor pools or indulge with a visit to the spa, where you'll find a range of therapeutic massages, body scrubs and wraps to help you unwind. Continue the decadence at the onsite restaurants, The Terrace and The Dining Room, both offering mouthwatering cuisine and a rotating menu of local delicacies crafted from the plentiful offerings of the East Sea.",
