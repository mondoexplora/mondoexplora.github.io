    "description": "Experience a wilderness retreat unlike any other at One&Only Nyungwe House, a five-star property dripping in jungle-flavoured luxury on the fringes of Rwanda's Nyungwe National Park. Be immersed in the serene beauty of Africa's oldest forest, surrounded by mountain landscapes and amidst a working tea plantation. During your stay, dine on a sustainable, farm-to-table menu at the onsite restaurant. Sit out on the open deck at the Tea Lounge & Bar to enjoy tea-infused cocktails and light snacks while watching the swaying canopy of the forest - if you're lucky, you might catch a glimpse of a chimpanzee or monkey swinging from the treetops. \n\nFor a dose of R&R, the One&Only Spa offers unbeatable spa treatments including a signature full-body Intoga Amasatchi massage to leave you feeling refreshed and rejuvenated.",
