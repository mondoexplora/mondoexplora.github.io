Dine across six exceptional venues, savour horseback rides along the shore or sail along the Sea of Cortez. Sink into the white sands of the resort’s private beach (the only in Los Cabos), take the plunge into the infinity pool or head straight to the spa for wellness treatments and energising body scrubs. You’ll never be too far from a bite to eat - between light lunch fare at La Terraza Americana, family favourites at Las Estrellas and authentic Mexican at La Palapa, you'll never go hungry. No stay at Esperanza is complete without experiencing Cocina del Mar - the cliffside restaurant is one of Los Cabos' best, with a soundtrack of crashing waves and fresh seafood, perfectly prepared.",
