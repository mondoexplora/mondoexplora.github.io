This breathtaking stretch of coastline emanates tropical elegance - while the local area is dotted with vibrant bars and trendy restaurants, this luxurious hotel feels quiet and exclusive thanks to a ring of Balinese gardens hiding three pools, a breathtaking spa and onsite restaurants. There's plenty to discover beyond the hotel - think Potato Head Beach Club and Mrs Sippy - but this luxury oasis has plenty to entice you to stay and simply lounge on the golden beachfront.\n\nWhile the little ones have the time of their lives at the Kids' Club, adults can indulge by the ocean-view infinity pool or embrace tranquillity at Tjakra-7 Spa. Treat yourself to a global dining affair at The Deli @ Pullman or opt for something a little more relaxed with a drink and small bite at one of three stunning bars. When you're ready to get out and explore, Legian Beach has an extraordinary wealth of attractions. From Legian's parasoled sands, vibrant beach parties and gently crashing surf to its abundance of art shops, nightclubs and restaurants, the region offers something for everyone.",
