    "description": "Experience the unique beauty of South Goa and Maravanthe coast in Karnataka by staying at two Postcard properties, a boutique collection of hotels by leaders trained in the art of slow luxury. With transformative experiences and the local community at the heart of The Postcard collection, you can expect intimate service as you encounter UNESCO World Heritage-listed buildings, beautiful beaches and breathtaking wildlife on your travels. Discover a whole new side of South Goa at The Postcard Hideaway Netravali, a 20-acre expanse that features just 20 treetop-inspired rooms hidden within the lush greenery of Netravali. The Postcard on the Arabian Sea is a beach-lovers paradise for it offers merely 9 luxury rooms scattered across a secluded stretch of coastline in Maravanthe, Karnataka.\n\nWhether you want to get away from the chaos of cities and enjoy a quiet holiday with your family or crave a beach holiday, you can unwind in total tranquility at both the Postcard hotels in Goa and Karnataka. Plus,  each hotel offers unique experiences that are true to its surroundings, giving guests a sense of the neighborhood and the destination in a way never seen before. The hotels are sustainably made and food is made with fresh local ingredients. Set breakfast hours and sugary welcome drinks are things of the past; in their place, The Postcard Collection puts emphasis on authentic local experiences - from food, to design, to artisanal welcome cocktails, to defining your own check-in and check-out hours and immersions within the local community.",
