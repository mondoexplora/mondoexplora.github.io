      "description": "Step back in time to discover Scottish countryside elegance and golfing history with an escape to The Rusacks St Andrews. Occupying an iconic 1800s building, the putter's playground is steeped in history, home to the world's oldest 18-hole course. Overlooking the picturesque town of St Andrews - and just a stone’s throw from Old Tom Morris’s famous Old Course Links - it’s a monument to golf and its founders, as well as a luxurious base for explorers of the seaside town, sitting just steps from the ocean. Don't love golf? Leave fans of the great game to drive their way down the green while you take in the impressive architecture of St Andrews Cathedral and St Andrews Castle, or visit the historic St Andrews University, known for educating world leaders and royals alike. Tipping its hat to its iconic location and history, this elegant escape is a masterclass in high-end country comforts, with grand open fireplaces, lofty ceilings, stone walls and embossed ceilings. Three restaurants and bars mean there's always something to delight, but the rooftop destination restaurant, 18, is the piece de resistance, offering open-flame cooking with a side of panoramic views over the Old Course and West Sands Beach. Pop by for a drink or sign up for a feast of Scottish oysters, beef, game and seafood. The light-filled The Bridge looks after all your culinary needs from dawn to dusk, with refined takes on full Scottish breakfasts and afternoon tea. Venturing onto the immaculate 18-hole golf course is a must for fans, but there are also countless other activities to entertain, from country sports to trail bike paths and beach activities.",
