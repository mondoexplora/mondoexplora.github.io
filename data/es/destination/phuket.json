With picturesque uninterrupted sea views from almost every corner, this tranquil haven dials up the romance, offering pure indulgence with a side of beachside bliss. Every room or suite has a front-row seat to the Andaman Sea, but it’s at the restaurants and bars that the serene setting comes into its own. Peel your eyes away from the floor-to-ceiling windows at the ultra-romantic Plum to focus on the charcoal oven, where prime cuts of beef and fresh seafood are expertly prepared, or venture to Vanilla Sky Bar for cocktails on the ocean-view terrace. Switch between lazing in the infinity pool and sipping on cocktails at the open-air Sienna Rocks Café, or slip into the resort's second pool, 30 metres long and lined with palm-fringed cabanas and a poolside restaurant. Restore mind and body with a traditional Thai massage or deep-cleansing facial at Balance Spa or, if you’ve got extra energy to burn, rally on the rooftop tennis court and get your blood pumping in the stylish gym.",
