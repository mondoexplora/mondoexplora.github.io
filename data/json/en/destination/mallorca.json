      "description": "Tucked into 80,000 squared metres of sun-soaked Mediterranean beauty, this family-friendly oasis feels more like a sanctuary than a hotel. Just a short stroll or shuttle ride from some of the island's best beaches, it's a place where you can unwind in peace or dive into fun. Seven tennis courts, heated pools and world-class spa facilities create an irresistible playground for making memories. Every meal here is something to look forward to. From hearty Mallorcan dishes that taste like tradition to fresh, creative Mediterranean plates, the food is full of personality and passion. Grab a wood-fired pizza by the pool, sip something cold as the sun goes down or linger over dinner at Llevant restaurant. Days blur into nights of pure enchantment. Whether it's kids splashing around under pirate ships or parents sneaking off to the spa, there's something for everyone. Blaudiland kids’ club keeps little adventurers spellbound, while grown-ups can dip into archery, table tennis or just a good book by the pool. From dawn till dusk, it’s the kind of place that makes ordinary days feel extraordinary.",
