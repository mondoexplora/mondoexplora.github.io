Indulge in five-star Filipino bliss at Crimson Resort and Spa Mactan, a sprawling six-hectare haven that epitomises luxury living.

It starts within an hour of landing at Mactan International Airport - the resort is just 20 minutes away. Find your spot by the oceanfront, three-tiered infinity pool or head straight for the sand, where you can while away the day rotating between sunlounger and sea.

If travelling with little ones, let their imaginations run wild in the Crimzone Club and pool, leaving you to soak up the sunshine, drink in hand. When the sun sets, leave the kids with the babysitter (charges apply) to enjoy a romantic, Spanish-inspired supper at Enye by Chele Gonzalez. **Luxury Escapes inclusions (select nights only)** - Feast on a varied **daily breakfast** at Saffron Café from 6.30am to 10.30am. - Start your stay with a **welcome cocktail per adult** - Hop between the resort’s six dining and drinking options with a **10% food and drink discount** - Relax a little bit more with **20% off spa treatments** throughout your stay - Sample the delicious fare of Saffron Café or Enye by Chele Gonzalez with **one lunch or dinner for two** (for stays of 3+ nights) - Go back for seconds with an **additional lunch or dinner for two** (two total; for stays of 5+ nights) - Please note the buffet dinner is offered at the Saffron Café Friday and Saturday nights only between 6pm and 10pm.
